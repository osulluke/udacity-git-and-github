I'm adding this file to test Git's ability to remove files.

After I added the file, 'git status' produces the following output:

On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	testRemove.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

After I moved the file out of the working area, 'git status' produces this:

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
