I'm adding this file to test Git's ability to remove files.

After I added the file, 'git status' produces the following output:

On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	testRemove.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

After I moved the file out of the working area, 'git status' produces this:

On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean


After adding 'test' to the tracked files

On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   test

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   gitNotes.txt
