This file was added from Github to show the use of the 'git pull' command...pretty cool!

Other things to figure out: 

  -Can I keep a working log of work to be done? This might be the only thing that would be useful at work (i.e. can I edit files that are already committed)?
  -I guess it might not be possible to 'add' a group of files? That's too bad...
