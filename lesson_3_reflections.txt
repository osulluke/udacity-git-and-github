This file was added from Github to show the use of the 'git pull' command...pretty cool!

Other things to figure out: 

  -Can I keep a working log of work to be done? This might be the only thing that would be useful at work (i.e. can I edit files that are already committed)?
  -I guess it might not be possible to 'add' a group of files? That's too bad...

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- It is necessary when you want to collarborate with other people; maybe when you want to share your work with the open-source community; when you would like a back-up of your work and data to be preserved in case you lose your hard drive or laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- If GitHub automatically pushed changes to the remotes, one, that would use up a lot of bandwidth unecessarily, two, it would also mean that any changes you made that were conflicts would have to be resolved by you - on GitHub's timeline...not an ideal timeline.
