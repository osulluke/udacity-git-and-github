What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	git will create a new folder/file system that will be used to track
all the future changes to the project. It has to be done in order to 'initialize' git...

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	The staging area lets me commit what I have 'ready' for commitment vs. what 
the most recent commit. This lets me compare back and forth and ensure that what
I have ready for commitment makes sense and is logically related to each other.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	They, pretty obviously will let you understand the structure of changes
that you have implemented in your code, but unfortunately, I'm not able to get
the same behavior out of the lesson that has been shown in the videos.
